A quick POC for arbitrary file upload vulnerability in https://makitweb.com/multiple-files-upload-at-once-with-php/ or https://makitweb.com/drag-and-drop-file-upload-with-jquery-and-ajax/

For testing purpose (will create an Apache/PHP docker container with vuln versions of the plugin):  
```./docker/install.sh```

You can examine the docker container with:

# docker run -it vuln bash
