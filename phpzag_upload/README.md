A quick POC for arbitrary file upload vulnerability in https://www.phpzag.com/drag-and-drop-file-upload-using-jquery-and-php/.

For testing purpose (will create an Apache/PHP docker container with vuln versions of the plugin):  
```./docker/install.sh```

You can examine the docker container with:

# docker run -it vuln bash
