A quick POC for CVE-2018-9206.

This exploit will attempt to find one of the three common variations of the software and upload a simple PHP shell.

I've done some testing against the 1000 forks of the original code and it seems only 36 were not vulnerable.  I found these only required a slight tweak to my exploit to get the majority of them working.

Results are in the file test_results.txt.  

Special Thanks to Phackt, @phackt_ul.

For testing purpose (will create an Apache/PHP docker container with vuln versions of the plugin):  
```./docker/install.sh```
